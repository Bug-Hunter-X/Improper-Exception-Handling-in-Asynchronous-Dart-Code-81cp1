# Dart Asynchronous Programming Error: Rethrowing Exceptions

This repository showcases a common error in Dart asynchronous programming and demonstrates a better approach. The original code uses `rethrow` inside the `catch` block which is not always ideal.  A more robust solution involves tailored error handling that helps to gracefully handle various scenarios and enhance user experience.

## Bug Description

The `bug.dart` file contains Dart code that fetches data asynchronously. However, the exception handling is insufficient. The `rethrow` statement passes the exception up the call stack, which might crash the application without providing adequate context or user feedback.

## Solution

The improved code in `bugSolution.dart` addresses this issue by:

1. **Specific Exception Handling**:  Catches more specific exceptions (like `FormatException` for JSON decoding errors). 
2. **Informative Error Messages**: Provides more user-friendly error messages.
3. **Default Error Handling**: Includes a default `catch` block for unexpected exceptions, preventing crashes and logging errors for debugging.

This demonstrates how to build a more resilient and user-friendly application by handling exceptions effectively.
